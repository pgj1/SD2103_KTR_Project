   <!-- Description below -->
        Final Projet: Create a new Web Applicaiton from scratch. <br>
		App Name: Kitchen Table Recipes (KTR) <br>
		Description: Most of us have slips of paper with recipes given to us from friends, 
		co-workers and family. How do we store them? How do we find that great tailgating 
		recipe from your co-worker? Kitchen Table Recipes is a Windows-based online recipe 
		box to keep track of those jewels. KTR lets you type in your recipe and then call 
		it up later to edit, view or print. You can safely upload grandmaâ€™s secret recipe 
		since private recipes are only accessible by the recipe owner. Your recipes are 
		only accessible by others if you designate the recipe as shared.  <br>

		-TECH STACK <br>
		   - C# <br>
		   - HTML <br>
		   - CSS <br>
